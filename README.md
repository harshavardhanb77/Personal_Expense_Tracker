Personal Expense Tracking and Analysis System
Overview
The Personal Expense Tracking and Analysis System is a data-driven project designed to help users manage, analyze, and forecast their personal expenses. This tool allows users to upload expense data,
visualize spending patterns, explore detailed breakdowns, and forecast future expenses using advanced predictive models.

Key features include:

Data Generation: Automated creation of sample expense data for testing.
Data Cleaning and Transformation: Ensures data accuracy and enriches the dataset with additional calculated fields.
Data Analysis and Visualization: Summarizes expenses through interactive visualizations and reports.
Predictive Modeling: Provides future expense forecasts using ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and XGBoost models.
Interactive Dashboard: An intuitive dashboard to explore expenses, trends, and forecasts.

Features
Data Generation: Simulates transaction data with multiple categories, payment methods, and merchants.
Data Cleaning: Removes duplicates, fills missing values, and standardizes formats for accurate analysis.
Data Transformation: Adds calculated fields like Transaction Type and Day of Week to enrich the dataset.
Data Visualization:
Expense breakdowns by category, payment method, and merchant.
Monthly and daily spending trends.
Day-of-week and seasonal spending patterns.
Predictive Modeling:
Forecasts monthly expenses using ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and XGBoost models.
Generates insights to support budgeting and financial planning.
Dashboard and Reports:
Interactive dashboard built with Dash for visual exploration of expenses.
Filtering options to view trends by category, date, or merchant.

Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, dash, statsmodels, xgboost, scikit-learn
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/expense-tracking-system.git
cd expense-tracking-system
Install Required Libraries
Use requirements.txt to install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
1. Data Generation
Generate sample expense data by running:

python
Copy code
python generate_data.py
This script creates enhanced_personal_expense_data.csv with simulated transaction data.

2. Data Cleaning and Analysis
To clean data and generate initial summary statistics, run:

python
Copy code
python data_cleaning_analysis.py
This script will handle data preprocessing and display initial visualizations for data insights.

3. Predictive Modeling
Run the ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or XGBoost models to forecast future expenses:

python
Copy code
python predictive_modeling.py
4. Dashboard
Launch the interactive dashboard with:

bash
Copy code
python app.py

Data Flow
Data Generation: The generate_data.py script simulates a dataset for realistic expense tracking scenarios.
Data Cleaning and Transformation: data_cleaning_analysis.py processes the dataset, removing duplicates, filling missing values, and adding additional calculated columns for analysis.
Data Analysis and Visualization: Generates visualizations for monthly spending, category distribution, and daily trends.
Predictive Modeling: predictive_modeling.py uses ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and XGBoost to forecast expenses for the next 12 months.
Dashboard: app.py runs the Dash-based dashboard, allowing users to interact with their expense data and view forecasts.
Models and Analysis
ARIMA: Models historical trends and forecasts monthly spending.
Exponential Smoothing: Captures trend and seasonality in spending patterns.
XGBoost: Implements a machine-learning approach to forecast future expenses, using lagged features to capture spending dependencies.
Each model is tuned to produce reliable forecasts that support the user's financial planning needs.
